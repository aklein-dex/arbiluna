# Arbiluna

This application will show you the price of different coins.

The idea is to create a cronjob to execute this application and send a notification (SNS) about what you should do.

## Setup

Simply install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

## Usage

### Deployment

Perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

* I didnt deploy it yet, so far I'm just testing locally.


### Local invocation

In order to test out the functions locally, you can invoke them with the following command:

```
npm run sls:local
```
